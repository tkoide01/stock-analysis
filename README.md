# Stock Analysis With Excel VBA

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The pupose of this project is to build a Microsoft Excel VBA code that analyze the provided dataset of stock and evaluate stocks' performance. In addition, the codes are expected to loop themselves to analyze the entire dataset at once by utilizing `for`loop and conditional settings. Lastly, we are further challenged to refactor the written codes to be efficient - by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

### The Data
The provided dataset have the 12 different stock information listed in two separate charts from year 2017 and 2018. On each chart, followings information are included; Ticker name of stock, Date the stock was issued, the opening, closing, highest, and lowest price, and the volume. In order to measure the performance of stocks, we utilized stocks' ticker, closing price and volume to calculate their yearly return.
